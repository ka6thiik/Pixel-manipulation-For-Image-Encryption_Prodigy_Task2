# Pixel-manipulation-For-Image-Encryption_Prodigy_Task2

**Image Encryption and Decryption Tool**  
This project demonstrates an image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation. The tool allows users to apply simple mathematical operations or swap pixel values to encrypt and decrypt images securely.

**The Image Encryption and Decryption Tool provides functionality to:**
Encrypt an image using simple pixel manipulation, such as adding a key to the pixel values.
Decrypt the image by reversing the encryption process with the same key.
Users can experiment with basic encryption methods like shifting pixel values or swapping them.

**Prerequisites**
To run this project, you need the following software installed:

Python 3.x: The primary programming language.

Pillow: A Python library used for opening and manipulating images.

To install Pillow, run:

pip install pillow

**Example Usage
Encrypting an Image**

Would you like to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt an image? E

Enter the path to the image file: C:\Users\User\Pictures\example.png

Enter the path to save the new image: C:\Users\User\Pictures\encrypted_example.png

Enter an integer key for encryption/decryption: 5

Decrypting an Image

Would you like to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt an image? D

Enter the path to the image file: C:\Users\User\Pictures\encrypted_example.png

Enter the path to save the new image: C:\Users\User\Pictures\decrypted_example.png

Enter an integer key for encryption/decryption: 5
